# Example

An example for experimenting with react-native-image-picker.

## Usage

Install dependencies using:

```bash
yarn install
```

Start the packager with:

```bash
yarn start
```

You may have noticed that we didn't have `react-native-image-picker` as a dependency, because we use `wml` to watch and copy files from `../` to `node_modules/react-native-image-picker`. Like this, we can develop in real-time using a symlink-like.
